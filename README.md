Hi this is Amitabh Deotale working with php since 2005 and now started working on odoo 10.0 , its really interesting.
So to share view things i have just uploaded some codes related to calculation of date based on the criteria like date of birth.
Please note if you are working on odoo 10.0 theen you have to install base module contacts.
Or you are just working on python then go the students/models/models.py and check for the last few lines of code.
Good Luck !
